## What is this?

Anchor is a mod+server that enables co-op on Ship of Harkinian. It's primary
functions are loading save state from a remote player when you join their
session, and sending flag sets/item gives across all players in a session. This
is not multi-world, and it requires that all players have the same randomizer
seed loaded, but this is a great example to reference for it and other
multiplayer ventures.

## How to

You don't technically need this, I'm hosting this on my end. Instead see
[the associated SoH Build](https://github.com/garrettjoecox/OOT/pull/52)

If you would like to host your own server:

- [Install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
- If you don't want to make any code changes, you can run it straight from
  github with

```sh
deno run --allow-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrettjoecox/anchor/main/mod.ts
```

- If you want to make code changes, clone the repo:
  https://github.com/garrettjoecox/anchor and run it with

```sh
deno run --allow-all mod.ts
```

- In the network tab update your remote IP to point to your server, eg:

```diff
-"gRemoteGIIP": "anchor.proxysaw.dev",
+"gRemoteGIIP": "127.0.0.1",
```

## Packet protocol

> This is for anyone wanting to extend the client side of anchor while still
> using the hosted server

Packets are delimited by a null terminator `\0`. Clients built prior to December
5th 2023 instead use a newline `\n` as a delimiter, if you are using one of
these clients you will need to use the `legacy-newline-terminator` branch of
this repo.

```ts
// Packets that the client will receive from server
interface IncomingPacket {
  type: string;
  roomId: string; // roomId which the client belongs to
  clientId?: number; // clientId whom the packet came from. Server can send packets so not always provided
  quiet?: boolean; // prevent this packet from logging. Any position/location packets should use this
  ...any valid json
}
// Packets the client sends to server
interface OutgoingPacket {
  type: string;
  roomId: string; // roomId which the client belongs to
  targetClientId?: number; // the server will only send this packet to the targetted client ID
  quiet?: boolean; // prevent this packet from logging. Any position/location packets should use this
  ...any valid json
}
```

All packets sent to server will be forwarded to all clients in the same room
with the following exceptions:

- If the packet contains a `targetClientId` it will only be forwarded to that
  one client
- If the packet is `PUSH_SAVE_STATE`, it will only be sent to clients who have
  requested a save state with `REQUEST_SAVE_STATE`

Upon joining a room a client should register it's `data` with the
`UPDATE_CLIENT_DATA` packet. The data should be an object with string keys and
arbitrary values, for example:

```json
{
  "type": "UPDATE_CLIENT_DATA",
  "roomId": "testRoom",
  "data": {
    "name": "ProxySaw",
    "color": { "r": 0, "g": 255, "b": 0 }
  }
}
```

Upon any client joining or leaving a room, an `ALL_CLIENT_DATA` packet is sent
to all clients with the remaining client's registered `data` for example:

```json
{
  "type": "ALL_CLIENT_DATA",
  "roomId": "testRoom",
  "clients": [
    {
      "clientId": 45,
      "name": "ProxySaw",
      "color": { "r": 0, "g": 255, "b": 0 }
    }
  ]
}
```

To clarify, it is up to the clients to send/parse this `data`, so this can be
anything you might want to store.
